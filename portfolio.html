      <center><p1>Here is a two player racing game I made in Scratch</p1><center>
      <center><p2>To use the red car, use "w" to move quickly and "a" and "d" to move on the sides.</p2></center>
      <center><p2>To use the blue car, use the up arrow to move quickly and the side arrows to move on the sides.</p2></center>
      <center><p3>The objective of the game is to get the most laps by crossing the red finish line.</p3></center>
      <center><p4>I should've added obstacles to make it more challenging.</p4></center>

      <center><p1>Here's a two person tic tac toe game made on MIT App Inventor.</p1></center>
      <center><p2>At first it didn't work, but we redid the coding and fixed the problem. The issue was in the part of the program determining when to change from X's to O's turn.</p2></center>
      <center><p3>This project could be made better by adding a score for how many times each player has won and adding a nice background.</p3></center>
      <center><p4>If this were an actual product, you wouldn't want to buy it because the app store has better games.</p4></center>

      <center><p5>The game works by setting conditions for victory in the "has won" procedure.</p5></center>
      <center><p6>Multiple procedures were made to ensure that the letters appear and alternate with each turn.</p6></center>
      <center><p7>Obviously, the winner is whoever connects three of their symbols together first.<p8></center>

      <center><p>Using Python and the online compiler repl.it, we made an interactive fiction story where the main character must escape a sinking ship.</p></center>

      <p><Here is the modified bounce simulation. I changed it from having circles to having arrows, and made sure that it bounced at a steeper angle></p>
